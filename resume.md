## Soft Skills

*Communication* I have a high level of communication skills developed through a mixture of activities including delivering training courses, service desk user support, development of technical documentation and technical presentations. This allows me to engage with a wide range of audiences in a clear, concise, and persuasive manner. -- Able to analyse customer requirements and translate them into proposals to management for defined service changes to improve customer experience.

*Organization and work under pressure* Able to manage stress, stay calm and focused, and make sound decisions in a fast-paced and rapidly changing situation. -- Capable of meeting strict deadlines, frequent interruptions, and unexpected challenges. -- Able to prioritize tasks, maintain composure, and communicate effectively with my team members, customers and management, while delivering high-quality work.

*Relationship management* Experience identifying key stakeholders and as well as their goals, needs, and challenges to ensure positive collaborations and increased business reputation. -- Proficient in understanding customer needs, providing technical guidance, and ensuring satisfaction through clear communication and consistent follow-up, resulting in improved service adoption and output production, leading to be recognised as co-author or acknowledged in several scientific papers. -- Built and maintained strong working relations with key technical staff (RSEs, Bioinformaticians) resulting in enhanced communication and collaboration with important research groups.

## Technical Skills

*Programming* Experience, as a practitioner, in multiple programming languages commonly used in the context of High-Performance Computing (e.g. Python, R, Bash, CUDA, C++), as well as certified experience as instructor for Python and Bash. -- Experience in installing, debugging and supporting technologies to enable reproducible research workflows (e.g. containers, version control using Git), as well as workflow managers (e.g. Nextflow, SnakeMake). -- Certified knowledge on Supervised Machine Learning (ML) concepts. This provides me with a more in depth understanding on how to build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression. In practice this allows me to be more effective at building and debugging ML applications, as well as understanding more easily customer requirements involving ML workflows.

*HPC software stack* Experience with popular job schedulers (SLURM, OpenPBS), environment management tools (Environment Modules, Anaconda, Mamba) and package managers (Spack).

*Software benchmarking and performance optimization* Experience in tuning and optimizing computationally demanding applications (e.g. Vasp, Gromacs) using multiple libraries to enable high-performance computing and parallel processing (e.g. OneAPI, OpenMPI, OpenMP), and various optimized math libraries (e.g. MKL, AOCL, OpenBlas), and accelerator enabled applications using common frameworks in AI/ML/DL (e.g. CUDA, Pytorch, Tensorflow).

*Customer life cycle and data management* Experience in all aspects of an HPC customer lifecycle, from providing initial information about the service, facilitating the creation of user and project accounts, supporting the transition from inexperienced to power user, building strong relations to ensure customer retention, and aiding during project closure.
-- Experience in advising customers with optimal data management strategies. Including use of centralised datasets to minimise data duplication; data compression; analysis; transfer; and backup solutions.

*Interactive platforms and Cloud services* Experience maintaining and debugging common user interfaces to enable students and researchers access to HPC resources interactively (e.g. Open OnDemand, JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, VNC). -- Experience managing virtual machines, via common automation engines (Ansible), for the hosting of software licence managers (e.g. FlexLM) as well as for hosting monitoring tools for the gathering of important system usage metrics (Lustre and NFS usage levels, GPU usage efficiency) -- Experience using monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus, XDMOD) for machine and application performance to minimise downtime and service inefficiency.


*Languages* Spanish (native), English (fluent)

## Work Experience

### *Jun 2018 -- present* Cardiff University -- Systems Support / Developer Analyst

Part of ARCCA (Advance Research Computing at Cardiff), a professional team dedicated to the provision of an efficient, effective and quality driven High Performance Computing service for researchers that need additional computing power to solve complex problems.

Main responsibilities within the position:

- Lead the delivery of training and enhanced support for HPC users. This includes the proposal, development, enhancement and maintenance of new and existing training courses based on user feedback and help request evidence.
- Lead the development user facing documentation covering the main aspects of using HPC systems. This includes the proposal and testing of new methods of user engagement with the objective of optimising the dissemination of best HPC practices.
- Support and monitor the use of software on HPC systems ensuring efficient applications and ease of use. This includes the assessment, development, tuning and support of a broad base of software packages and applications that reflect the   requirements of researchers.
- Contribute to the delivery of white papers, mini projects and publications through enhanced project support.
- Maintain application support processes, and check that all requests for support are dealt with according to agreed procedures. Use of application management software and tools to investigate issues, collect performance statistics and create reports.

### *Jun 2023 -- Jun 2024* University of Oxford -- Data and IT Specialist (part time)

Part of a team that provides support for an international multi-site study on understanding the impact of COVID-19 on bacterial sepsis, antibiotic consumption and stewardship, and antimicrobial resistance, funded by the Wellcome Trust.

Main responsibilities within the position:

- Solving IT technical problems which will include installing and upgrading system components, setting up software, resolving IT and hardware issues.
- Help in developing methodologies for data collection, data cleaning, data sorting and analysis in terms of writing scripts and generating data pipelines.
- Responsible for data backup, data security, data digitalization and helping with the data analysis.
- Contribute ideas and communicate effectively with database experts and scientific programmers where appropriate.
- Develop or tailor analytical tools and resources appropriate to the work along with the PI and the Project’s Scientific lead.
- Contribute to manuscripts, presentations and other means of disseminating results.

### *Jan 2015 -- Jan 2018* Cardiff University -- Research Associate
Part of INSPIRE project financed (£700K) by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The INSPIRE consortium is an interdisciplinary partnership incorporating a diverse range of requisite disciplines including environmental and geotechnical engineering, environmental and social science, polymer chemistry, and microbiology. In addition, a number of industrial and governmental partners are involved.

Main responsibilities within the project:

- Development of bespoke numerical and analytical models to describe heterogeneous flow processes and resource mobilisation and transport. This includes the use of the finite element method for modelling of transient, heterogeneous and microbiologically manipulated flow in porous geological materials via consideration of multi-scale pore networks. The numerical model is validated against experimental data carried out by project partners.
- Identification and achievement of research goals.
- Collaboration with project’s industrial partners to explore practical aspects of the proposed system in a range of different real field environments.
- To undertake numerical analysis and contribute intellectually to the project thorough the critical interpretation of data.
- Promotion of research work and institution.
- Management of research budgets and resources.
- Identifying funding opportunities and pursuing these successfully.
- Representation of research staff opinions to senior management.
- Co-supervision of research students (4).
- Effective communication of project outcomes to a range of audiences.
